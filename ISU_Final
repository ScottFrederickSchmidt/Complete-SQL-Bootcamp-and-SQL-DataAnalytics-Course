SQL IT378 Final Practice:
A company wants to maintain a database regarding computer systems, software, and owners. 
This database can then be used to check periodically for bootleg software,
and it can be used to make sure that the latest, greatest version of software packages get to all owners.  Each computer has only one owner (the person on who’s desk it sits),
but each software package may be on many computers, and each computer can have many software packages installed. 

1.	For each employee, list first name, last name, office number, and the computer ID for each computer owned. Sort in alphabetical order by employee last name.
SELECT o.emp_fname, o.emp_o.emp_lname, o.office_no, c.comp_id 
FROM owner o, computer c
WHERE o.emp_id=c.comp_id
ORDER BY o.emp_lname

2.	Assuming that the software listed is the only software the company is willing to support, what are my choices for database applications?
SELECT SWName, Software_ID 
FROM software s
WHERE c.oper_sys LIKE ‘%database%’; 

3.	List the title and price of all software currently installed. Sort by title.
SELECT s.SWName, s.software_id 
FROM software s, installed i
WHERE i.software_id=s.software_id;



4.	What is the total cost of software installed on computer 101?
SELECT comp_id, sum(s.SWprice)
 FROM software s, installed I, c
WHERE c.comp_id=101
s.software_id=i.software_id
ORDER BY c.comp_id

5.	List the first and last name of all employees currently using machines with MS Word installed.
SELECT emp_fname, emp_lname
FROM owner
WHERE emp_no  IN
 (SELECT emp_no WHERE 
FROM owner o, computer c, installed i, software s
WHERE c.comp_id=i.comp_id
AND i.software_id=s.software_id
AND SWName = ‘MS Word’); 

6.	List first and last name of owners who do not have MS Word installed on their machines.
SELECT emp_fname, emp_lname
FROM owner
WHERE emp_no NOT IN
 (SELECT emp_no WHERE 
FROM owner o, computer c, installed i, software s
WHERE c.comp_id=i.comp_id
AND i.software_id=s.software_id
AND SWName = ‘MS Word’); 


7.	Write a parameter query to find the total cost of software installed on anyone's machine?

MY ANSWER:
SELECT sum(s.SWprice)
FROM owner o, software s, installed I, computer c
WHERE c.comp_id=i.comp_id
AND i.software_id=s.software_id
GROUP BY c.comp_id
ORDER BY c.comp_id;

OFFICIAL ANSWER:

SELECT sum(s.SWprice)
FROM owner o, software s, installed I, computer c
WHERE c.comp_id=i.comp_id
AND i.software_id=s.software_id
AND comp_id=?;


8.	List the names of everyone who owns more than 1 computer.
SELECT emp_fname, emp_lname 
FROM owner 
WHERE emp_no IS 
(SELECT emp_no 
FROM computer
HAVING count(*)>1);


9.	What's the most expensive software supported?
SELECT software_id, max(SWprice) 
FROM software
GROUP BY software_i;


10.	Which owners have the most expensive software installed on their machines?
SELECT emp_id, emp_fnane, emp_lname
FROM OWNER 
WHERE emp_id IN 
(SELECT emp_id
FROM OWNER 
WHERE computer.comp_id=installed.comp_id
AND installed.software_id=software.software_id
HAVING max(SWprice));
