SQL IT378 Final Practice:
A company wants to maintain a database regarding computer systems, software, and owners. 
This database can then be used to check periodically for bootleg software,
and it can be used to make sure that the latest, greatest version of software packages get to all owners.  Each computer has only one owner (the person on who’s desk it sits),
but each software package may be on many computers, and each computer can have many software packages installed. 


1.	For each employee, list first name, last name, office number, and the computer ID for each computer owned. Sort in alphabetical order by employee last name.
SELECT o.emp_fname, o.emp_o.lname, o.office_no, c.comp_id 
FROM owner o, computer c
WHERE o.emp_id=c.comp_id;

2.	Assuming that the software listed is the only software the company is willing to support, what are my choices for database applications?
SELECT SWName, Software_ID 
FROM software s; 

3.	List the title and price of all software currently installed. Sort by title.
SELECT s.SWName, s.software_id 
FROM software s, installed i
WHERE i.serial_no=s.software_id;



4.	What is the total cost of software installed on computer 101?
SELECT total(s.SWprice)
 FROM software s, installed i, computer c
WHERE c.comp_id=101
AND c.comp_id=i.serial_no
AND i.serial_no=s.software_ID;

5.	List the first and last name of all employees currently using machines with MS Word installed.
SELECT o.emp_fname, o.emp_lname
FROM owner o, installed i, computer c, software s
WHERE s.SWName= ‘MS Word’;

6.	List first and last name of owners who do not have MS Word installed on their machines.
SELECT o.emp_fname, o.emp_lname
FROM owner o, software s
WHERE s.SWName != ‘MS Word’;


7.	Write a parameter query to find the total cost of software installed on anyone's machine?
SELECT o.emp_id, TOTAL(s.SWprice)
FROM owner o, software s, installed I, computer c
GROUP BY o.emp_id
ORDER BY o.emp.id;

8.	List the names of everyone who owns more than 1 computer.
SELECT o.emp_fname, o.emp_lname 
FROM owner o, computer c
WHERE count(c.comp_ID>1);

9.	What's the most expensive software supported?
SELECT SWName, software_ID 
FROM software 
      ORDER BY SWprice
LIMIT 1;

10.	Which owners have the most expensive software installed on their machines?
SELECT s.SWName, s.software_iD
FROM software s, owner o, computer c, installed i
WHERE o.emp_id=c.comp_id
AND c.comp_id=i.serial_no;
