-------------------
Using HAVING is used when using the COUNT function.
Using HAVING is used on aggregate functions. 
HAVING is used with GROUP BY and aggregrate functions.
Generally, use WHERE clause.

Select all the information from the “salaries” table regarding contracts from 66,000 to 70,000 dollars per year.
Retrieve a list with all individuals whose employee number is not between ‘10004’ and ‘10012’.

------------------
AGGERATE FUNCTIONS EXERCISE:

How many annual contracts with a value higher than or equal to $100,000 have been registered in the salaries table?
How many managers do we have in the “employees” database? Use the star symbol (*) in your code to solve this exercise.

SELECT COUNT (*) FROM salaries WHERE salary > 100000;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dept_manager;


-----------------
Select all data from the “employees” table, ordering it by “hire date” in descending order.'
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date DESC;




-----------------------
USING ALIAS (AS)

Write a query that obtains two columns. The first column must contain annual salaries higher than 80,000 dollars. 
The second column, renamed to “emps_with_same_salary”, must show the number of employees contracted to that salary. Lastly, sort the output by the first column.

SELECT salary, COUNT (emp_no) AS emps_with_same_salary GROUP BY salary ORDER BY salary;

-----------------------

---------------------
WHERE VS HAVING:

Select the employee numbers of all individuals who have signed more than 1 contract after the 1st of January 2000
SELECT emp_no FROM dept_emp WHERE from_date > '2000-01-01' HAVING COUNT(from_date)>1 ORDER BY emp_no;

-------------------
LIMIT

Select the first 100 rows from the ‘dept_emp’ table. 
SELECT * FROM dept_temp LIMIT 100;
