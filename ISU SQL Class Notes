Three data modeling problems

RELATIONAL SCHEMA
#29 Workbook
Conduct is one to many, therefore conduct does NOT become an entity.
Includes is many to many so it becomes an entity.
Perform only gets #soloID, #CID, and #concertNum as a foreign key. It does NOT get conductor as a foreign key because they are NOT connected.

NORMALIZATION
similiar to #32 in workbook, page 22

Can create a 8.5 x 11 cheat sheet for midterm
