Intro to JOINs - exercise 1

If you currently have the ‘departments_dup’ table set up, use DROP COLUMN to remove the ‘dept_manager’ column from the ‘departments_dup’ table.
Then, use CHANGE COLUMN to change the ‘dept_no’ and ‘dept_name’ columns to NULL.
(If you don’t currently have the ‘departments_dup’ table set up, create it. Let it contain two columns: dept_no and dept_name. Let the data type of dept_no be CHAR of 4, and the data type of dept_name be VARCHAR of 40. Both columns are allowed to have null values. Finally, insert the information contained in ‘departments’ into ‘departments_dup’.)
Then, insert a record whose department name is “Public Relations”.
Delete the record(s) related to department number two.
Insert two new records in the “departments_dup” table. Let their values in the “dept_no” column be “d010” and “d011”.
